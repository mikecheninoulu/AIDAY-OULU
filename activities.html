					<p>Talk 1 -- <strong>Phong Nguyen-Ha: "Free-Viewpoint RGB-D Human Performance Capture and Rendering."</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Abstract</strong> Novel view synthesis for humans in motion is a challenging computer vision problem that enables applications such as free-viewpoint video. Existing methods typically use complex setups with multiple input views, 3D supervision or pre-trained models that do not generalize well to new identities. Aiming to address these limitations, we present a novel view synthesis framework to generate realistic renders from unseen views of any human captured from a single-view sensor with sparse RGB-D, similar to a low-cost depth camera, and without actor-specific models. We propose an architecture to learn dense features in novel views obtained by sphere-based neural rendering, and create complete renders using a global context inpainting model. Additionally, an enhancer network leverages the overall fidelity, even in occluded areas from the original view, producing crisp renders with fine details. We show our method generates high-quality novel views of synthetic and real human actors given a single sparse RGB-D input. It generalizes to unseen identities, new poses and faithfully reconstructs facial expressions. Our approach outperforms prior human view synthesis methods and is robust to different levels of input sparsity.</p>

					<p>Talk 2 -- <strong>Zhaodong Sun: "Contrast-Phys: Unsupervised Video-based Remote Physiological Measurement via Spatiotemporal Contrast."</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Video-based remote physiological measurement utilizes face videos to measure the blood volume change signal, which is also called remote photoplethysmography (rPPG). Supervised methods for rPPG measurements achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, supervised rPPG methods require face videos and ground truth physiological signals for model training. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised rPPG measurement method that does not require ground truth signals for training. We use a 3DCNN model to generate multiple rPPG signals from each video in different spatiotemporal locations and train the model with a contrastive loss based on the prior knowledge of rPPG. The results show that our method outperforms the previous unsupervised baseline and achieves accuracies very close to the current best supervised rPPG methods. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that our approach can run at a much faster speed and is more robust to noises than the previous unsupervised baseline.</p>

                                        <p>Talk 3 -- <strong>Martin Trapp: " Uncertainty-guided source-free domain adaptation."</strong></p>
					<p><b>Abstract:</b> Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a classifier to an unlabelled target data set by only using a pre-trained source model. However, the absence of the source data and the domain shift makes the predictions on the target data unreliable. We propose quantifying the uncertainty in the source model predictions and utilizing it to guide the target adaptation. For this, we construct a probabilistic source model by incorporating priors on the network parameters inducing a distribution over the model predictions. Uncertainties are estimated by employing a Laplace approximation and incorporated to identify target data points that do not lie in the source manifold and to down-weight them when maximizing the mutual information on the target data. Unlike recent works, our probabilistic treatment is computationally lightweight, decouples source training and target adaptation, and requires no specialized source training or changes of the model architecture. We show the advantages of uncertainty-guided SFDA over traditional SFDA in the closed-set and open-set settings and provide empirical evidence that our approach is more robust to strong domain shifts even without tuning. </p>

				        <p>Three talks are given by <b>Heikki Huttunen</b>, <b>Yuxin Hou</b> and <b>Yang Liu</b>.</p>
					<p>Talk 1 -- <strong>Heikki Huttunen: "Computer vision for ports and terminals."</strong></p>
					<p><b>Abstract:</b> International ports compete to best serve their customers in terms of efficiency and safety, and automation is a key tool in improving the cargo handling processes. Artificial intelligence both improves safety by moving potentially dangerous cargo handling tasks from humans to machines; and facilitates new ways of data collection for new level of situational awareness. In this talk, we will discuss the automation needs of modern mid-size to large cargo terminals, and will present a few case examples of how computer vision is used to solve these needs. The cases utilize a wide spectrum of deep learning techniques, ranging from basic tasks: detection, semantic segmentation and classification; to more specialized tasks, such as optical character recognition and face recognition. In the end, the business significance of artificial intelligence as well as the disruptions it can bring to the industry are discussed. </p>

					<p>Talk 2 -- <strong>Yuxin Hou: "Implicit Map Augmentation for Relocalization."</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Abstract</strong> Learning neural radiance fields (NeRF) has recently revolutionized novel view synthesis and related topics. The fact that the implicit scene models learned via NeRF greatly extend the representational capability compared with sparse maps, however, is largely overlooked. In this talk, we will show the implicit map augmentation that uses implicit scene representation to augment the sparse maps and help with visual relocalization. Given a sparse map reconstructed by structure-from-motion, we firstly train a NeRF model conditioned on the sparse point cloud. Then an augmented sparse map representation can be sampled from the NeRF model, which can be plugged into a traditional visual localization pipeline directly. The experiments demonstrate that using augmented maps achieves better relocalization results on challenging views. .</p>

					<p>Talk 3 -- <strong>Yang Liu: "Graph-based Facial Affect Analysis: Trends and Applications."</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> As one of the most important affective signals, facial affect analysis (FAA) is essential for developing human-computer interaction systems. Early methods focus on extracting appearance and geometry features while ignoring the latent semantic information among individual facial changes, leading to limited performance and generalization. Recent work attempts to establish a graph-based representation to model these semantic relationships and develop frameworks to leverage them for various FAA tasks. We provide a comprehensive review of graph-based FAA, including the evolution of algorithms, SOTA frameworks, and open directions. Finally, we also propose a new graph-based method for uncertain facial expression recognition. Based on the latent dependency between emotions and Action Units (AUs), an auxiliary branch using graph convolutional layers is added to extract the semantic information from graph topologies. A re-labeling strategy corrects the ambiguous annotations by comparing their feature similarities with semantic templates. Experiments on large-scale datasets reveal a substantial performance improvement.</p>

					<p>Talk 2 -- <strong>Serkan Kiranyaz: "New-Generation Neural Networks and Applications."</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Abstract</strong> Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), and their derivatives, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have a common drawback: they employ a homogenous network structure with an identical ‚Äúlinear‚Äù neuron model. This naturally makes them only a crude model of the biological neurons or mammalian neural systems, which are heterogeneous and composed of highly diverse neuron types with distinct biochemical and electrophysiological properties. With such crude models, conventional homogenous networks can learn sufficiently well problems with a monotonous, relatively simple, and linearly separable solution space but they fail to accomplish this whenever the solution space is highly nonlinear and complex. To address this drawback, a heterogeneous and dense network model, Generalized Operational Perceptrons (GOPs) has recently been proposed. GOPs aim to model biological neurons with distinct synaptic connections. GOPs have demonstrated a superior diversity, encountered in biological neural networks, which resulted in an elegant performance level on numerous challenging problems where conventional MLPs entirely failed. Following GOPs footsteps, a heterogeneous and non-linear network model, called Operational Neural Network (ONN), has recently been proposed as a superset of CNNs. ONNs, like their predecessor GOPs, boost the diversity to learn highly complex and multi-modal functions or spaces with minimal network complexity and training data.  However, ONNs also exhibit certain drawbacks such as strict dependability to the operators in the operator set library, the mandatory search for the best operator set for each layer/neuron, and the need for setting (fixing) the operator sets of the output layer neuron(s) in advance. Self-organized ONNs (Self-ONNs) with generative neurons can address all these drawbacks without any prior search or training and with elegant computational complexity. However, generative neurons still perform ‚Äúlocalized‚Äù kernel operations and hence the kernel size of a neuron at a particular layer solely determines the capacity of the receptive fields and the amount of information gathered from the previous layer. In order to improve the receptive field size and to even to find the best possible location for each kernel, non-localized kernel operations for Self-ONNs are embedded in a novel and superior neuron model than the generative neurons hence called the ‚Äúsuper (generative) neurons‚Äù. This talk will cover a natural evolution of the artificial neuron and network models starting from the ancient (linear) neuron model in the 1940s to the super neurons and new-generation Self-ONNs. The focus will particularly be drawn on numerous Image Processing applications such as image restoration, denoising, and regression where Self-ONNs especially with super neurons have achieved state-of-the-art performance levels with a significant gap.            .</p>

					<p>Talk 3 -- <strong>Abol Basher: "LightSAL: Lightweight Sign Agnostic Learning for Implicit Surface Representation."</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recently, several works have addressed modeling of 3D shapes using deep neural networks to learn implicit surface representations. Up to now, the majority of works have concentrated on reconstruction quality, paying little or no attention to model size or training time. This work proposes LightSAL, a novel deep convolutional architecture for learning 3D shapes; the proposed work concentrates on efficiency both in network training time and resulting model size. We build on the recent concept of Sign Agnostic Learning for training the proposed network, relying on signed distance fields, with unsigned distance as ground truth. In the experimental section of the paper, we demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperforms previous work in model size and number of required training iterations, while achieving equivalent accuracy. Experiments are based on the D-Faust dataset that contains 41k 3D scans of human shapes.</p>

                                        <p>Talk 4 -- <strong>Jaakko Lehtinen: "Alias-Free Generative Adversarial Networks." (postponed)*(</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We observe that despite their hierarchical convolutional nature, the synthesis process of typical generative adversarial networks depends on absolute pixel coordinates in an unhealthy manner. This manifests itself as, e.g., detail appearing to be glued to image coordinates instead of the surfaces of depicted objects. We trace the root cause to careless signal processing that causes aliasing in the generator network. Interpreting all signals in the network as continuous, we derive generally applicable, small architectural changes that guarantee that unwanted information cannot leak into the hierarchical synthesis process. The resulting networks match the FID of StyleGAN2 but differ dramatically in their internal representations, and they are fully equivariant to translation and rotation even at subpixel scales. Our results pave the way for generative models better suited for video and animation.</p>
