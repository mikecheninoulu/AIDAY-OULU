					<p>Talk 1 -- <strong>Matti Pietikäinen: "Machine Vision Group: 40 Years of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Research."</strong></p>
					<p><b>Abstract:</b> The Machine Vision Group (MVG) at the University of Oulu celebrates it’s 40th Anniversary in 2021. This talk will first present objectives and scientific impact of our research, as well as it’s impact on ecosystem development. Then, some highlights of the past research are presented, including approaches for texture-based image and video description with local binary patterns (LBP), geometric camera calibration, and face and facial expression analysis. Various application examples of this research are also shown. Next, the current focus areas of CMVS research are introduced, including learning image, video & 3-D representations, affective computing, geometric 3-D vision, bio-signal analysis, and embedded vision systems. Examples of this research are presented, dealing with energy and sample efficient AI, facial expression and micro-expression analysis, context recognition with 3-D view synthesis, multimodal video-based bio-signal extraction, and ”flat” imaging for embedded perceptual user interfaces. Finally, a new project on emotion AI is briefly introduced. </p>

					<p>Talk 2 -- <strong>Abol Basher: "LightSAL: Lightweight Sign Agnostic Learning for Implicit Surface Representation."</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recently, several works have addressed modeling of 3D shapes using deep neural networks to learn implicit surface representations. Up to now, the majority of works have concentrated on reconstruction quality, paying little or no attention to model size or training time. This work proposes LightSAL, a novel deep convolutional architecture for learning 3D shapes; the proposed work concentrates on efficiency both in network training time and resulting model size. We build on the recent concept of Sign Agnostic Learning for training the proposed network, relying on signed distance fields, with unsigned distance as ground truth. In the experimental section of the paper, we demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperforms previous work in model size and number of required training iterations, while achieving equivalent accuracy. Experiments are based on the D-Faust dataset that contains 41k 3D scans of human shapes.</p>

                                        <p>Talk 4 -- <strong>Jaakko Lehtinen: "Alias-Free Generative Adversarial Networks."</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We observe that despite their hierarchical convolutional nature, the synthesis process of typical generative adversarial networks depends on absolute pixel coordinates in an unhealthy manner. This manifests itself as, e.g., detail appearing to be glued to image coordinates instead of the surfaces of depicted objects. We trace the root cause to careless signal processing that causes aliasing in the generator network. Interpreting all signals in the network as continuous, we derive generally applicable, small architectural changes that guarantee that unwanted information cannot leak into the hierarchical synthesis process. The resulting networks match the FID of StyleGAN2 but differ dramatically in their internal representations, and they are fully equivariant to translation and rotation even at subpixel scales. Our results pave the way for generative models better suited for video and animation.</p>
					<p><strong><a href="https://users.aalto.fi/~lehtinj7/">Jaakko Lehtinen</a></strong> is a tenured associate professor at Aalto University, and a principal research scientist at NVIDIA Research. I work on computer graphics, computer vision, and machine learning, with particular interests in generative modelling, realistic image synthesis, and appearance acquisition and reproduction. Overall, I'm fascinated by the combination of machine learning techniques with physical simulators in the search for robust, interpretable AI.

Prior to taking my current positions, I spent 2007-10 as a postdoc with Frédo Durand at MIT. Before my research career, I worked for the game developer Remedy Entertainment in 1996-2005 as a graphics programmer, and contributed significantly to the graphics technology behind the worldwide blockbuster hit games Max Payne (2001), Max Payne 2 (2003), and Alan Wake (2009).</p>
